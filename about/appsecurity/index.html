      <h2>
        Google’s vulnerability disclosure policy
      </h2>
      <p>
        We believe that vulnerability disclosure is a two-way street. Vendors, as well as
        researchers, must act responsibly. This is why Google adheres to a 90-day disclosure
        deadline. We notify vendors of vulnerabilities immediately, with details shared in public
        with the defensive community after 90 days, or sooner if the vendor releases a fix. That
        deadline can vary in the following ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If a deadline is due to expire on a weekend or US public holiday, the deadline will be
        moved to the next normal work day.
        </li>
        <li>Before the 90-day deadline has expired, if a vendor lets us know that a patch is
        scheduled for release on a specific day that will fall within 14 days following the
        deadline, we will delay the public disclosure until the availability of the patch.
        </li>
        <li>When we observe a previously unknown and unpatched vulnerability in software under
        active exploitation (a “0day”), we believe that more urgent action—within 7 days—is
        appropriate. The reason for this special designation is that each day an actively exploited
        vulnerability remains undisclosed to the public and unpatched, more devices or accounts
        will be compromised. Seven days is an aggressive timeline and may be too short for some
        vendors to update their products, but it should be enough time to publish advice about
        possible mitigations, such as temporarily disabling a service, restricting access, or
        contacting the vendor for more information. As a result, after 7 days have elapsed without
        a patch or advisory, we will support researchers making details available so that users can
        take steps to protect themselves.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As always, we reserve the right to bring deadlines forwards or backwards based on extreme
        circumstances. We remain committed to treating all vendors strictly equally. Google expects
        to be held to the same standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        This policy is strongly in line with our desire to improve industry response times to
        security bugs, but also results in softer landings for bugs marginally over deadline. We
        call on all researchers to adopt disclosure deadlines in some form, and feel free to use
        our policy verbatim if you find our record and reasoning compelling. Creating pressure
        towards more reasonably-timed fixes will result in smaller windows of opportunity for
        blackhats to abuse vulnerabilities. In our opinion, vulnerability disclosure policies such
        as ours result in greater overall safety for users of the Internet.
